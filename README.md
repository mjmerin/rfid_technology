# RFID Technology

RFID Technology is the senior design project of [Seattle University](www.seattleu.edu) Team ECE 08.5. It's members consist of Riley Higa, Andrew Kurniadi, Min Kyeong Lee, [Mark Merin](www.github.com/mjmerin), and Robert Nguon. 

The project was sponsored by [Philips Healthcare](usa.philips.com/Healthcareâ€Ž) and guided by its engineers Dale Chermak and Matthew Rieger.

This was a year long project that consisted of creating a means to track patient data through RFID. 

The end result was a prototype RFID reader that could read and write RFID tags using a Windows app.
